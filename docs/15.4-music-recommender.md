- Issues
  - SQLite escaping
    - Python arguments should be sanitized before going into cursor.execute (or similar)
    - For multiple arguments (e.g. `WHERE column in (...)`): `sql_query.format(('?,'*len(arguments))[:-1])`
    - Arguments should always be a tuple (number of bindings error)

- Packages
  - operator.itemgetter: Return a callable object that fetches the given item(s) from its operand.
    - After f = itemgetter(2), the call f(r) returns r[2].
    - After g = itemgetter(2, 5, 3), the call g(r) returns (r[2], r[5], r[3])

- Algorithms
  - Core concept: similar song id's appear close to each other (words are to texts like songs are to playlists)
  - Fit a pre-trained Word2Vec model on playlists data
    - Create iterator to yield song id's ("words") per playlist
  - Use trained model to retrieve songs
    1. Query database to get info of songs with a similar name to the one queried.
    2. Use model to rank songs by popularity (frequency in `model.wv.vocab`)
  - Use trained model to recommend songs
    1. Get similar songs from model: `model.wv.most_similar(song_id)`
    2. Query database for info of similar songs.
    3. Rank songs by similarity score from model.
