  - Too little number of tries?

- Packages
  - spotipy: super cool Spotify Python API
    - It can even get the audio!!!
  - sqlite3: Python API for SQLite

- Algorithms
  - Set up a new Spotify app to access the API
    - Needs configuration: callback, token cache removal (issue with scope)
  - Fetch playlists by keyword search
    - Like using the search bar in the app
    - Use generator to save memory
      - DON'T raise StopIteration; it is deprecated. Use return instead.
    - Limit the number of search results and the length of the yielded iterator
    - Spotify returns playlists as paging objects: use sesssion.next(playlist)
    - Could be seeded with a different word, e.g. rock (biased?)
  - Fetch and save tracks by playlist
    - Generator and paging object as with playlists
    - Write each new track to an SQLite DB, song ids per playlist to a text file and playlist info to an ndjson (json separated by newlines -> easier to update than json)
    - Use a try-except block to catch problems with specific playlists (e.g. 3ZL3B9QN8N5uSTc7xw0LP7) without stopping the whole thing
    - TAKES A LOT OF TIME
