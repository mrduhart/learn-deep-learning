- Issues
  - Needs to install ffmpeg for librosa.load to work with mp3s:
    sudo apt-get install ffmpeg
  - tqdm fails in notebook

- Packages
  - tinytag: reads mp3 metadata
  - sounddevice: audio playing, recording and others (problem querying device)
  - tqdm: progress bars (needs tqdm.notebook and jupyter extensions for Jupyter)
  - IPython.display for playing audio in notebook

- Algorithms
  - First FCN layer as song embedding
  - KNN for finding similar songs
    - Neighbors for all segments of song (3-second splits) + voting system for final score
    - KD tree and ball tree improve efficiency
